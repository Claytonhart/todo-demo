# Rapptr Labs challenge

Create a simple to-do app in React.
Hosted live at [Todo Demo](https://claytonhart.github.io/todo-demo/)

# Time Allotment

This demo took approximately 4 hours all together to complete.

- 1 hour was spent on reading the test requirements, then planning initial styling, layout and logic of the app.
- 1 hour was spent building out the login page and implementing all of the correct form validations and styling.
- 1 hour was then spent implementing the main todo list page and ensuring the state of each item was reflected correctly throughout each potential state change, including filtering by search.
- The final hour was spent cleaning up styling and logic, then hosting the website and writing up this post-mortem and final email.
